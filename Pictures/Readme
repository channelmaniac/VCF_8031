This cheap USB to TTL Serial adapter was purchased off AliExpress and included in the kit. In Qty 100 they were less than 90 cents each direct from China. I felt that for an initial computer kit for many new builders this build would need to have everything needed to connect and make it run including a wall wart power supply and the USB to TTL Serial adapter.
